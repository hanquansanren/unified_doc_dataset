# Weiguang Zhang's Triple-Mix-Doc dataset

# Speed overview
By following the tips, we can reach achieve **~730 images/second** with PyTorch when training ResNet-50 on ImageNet. According to benchmark reported on [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/performance/benchmarks) and [MXNet](https://github.com/apache/incubator-mxnet/tree/master/example/image-classification), the performance is still competitive.

# Key Points of Efficiency 
Now most frameworks adapt `CUDNN` as their backends. Without special optimization, the inference time is similiar across frameworks. To optimize training time, we focus on other points such as 

## Data Loader
The default combination `datasets.ImageFolder` + `data.DataLoader` is not enough for large scale classification. According to my experience, even I upgrade to Samsung 960 Pro (read 3.5 GB/s, write 2.0 GB/s), whole training pipeline still suffers at disk I/O.

The reason causing is the slow reading of **discountiuous small chunks**. To optimize, we need to dump small JPEG images into a large binary file. TensorFlow has its own `TFRecord` and MXNet uses `recordIO`. Beside these two, there are other options like `hdf5`, `pth`, `n5`, `lmdb` etc. Here I choose `lmdb` because

1. `TFRecord` is a private protocal which is hard to hack into. `RecordIO`'s documentation is confusing and do not provide a clean python API.
2. `hdf5` `pth` `n5`, though with a straightforward json-like API, require to put the whole file into memory. This is not practicle when you play with large dataset like imagenet. 

## Data Parallel

The default data parallel of PyTorch, powerd by `nn.DataParallel`, is in-efficienct! Fisrt, because the GIL of Python, multi-threading do not fully utilize all cores [torch/nn/parallel/parallel_apply.py#47](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/master/torch/nn/parallel/parallel_apply.py#L47). Second, the collective scheme of `DataParallel` is to gather all results on `cuda:0`. It leads to imbalance workload and sometimes OOM especially you are running segmentation models. 

`nn.DistributedDataParllel` provides a more elegant solution: Instead of launching call from different threads, it starts with multiple processes (no GIL) and assigns a balanced workload for all GPUs.
